# UPM Composite Action

A simple [composite action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/creating-a-composite-run-steps-action) that can be used to publish new release for the Unity package manager (UPM) using the [semantic release action](https://github.com/cycjimmy/semantic-release-action).

The action is primarily used to simplify the workflow file and avoid duplicating jobs for UPM monorepos.
